## Problem Statement

This Tableau project visualizes global earthquake data over the past century. The dashboard provides insights into the frequency, magnitude, and geographical distribution of earthquakes, helping users understand trends and patterns in seismic activity.

### Steps followed 

- 1. Data Collection : Gather earthquake data from reliable sources, primarily the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Ensure the dataset includes essential fields such as date, magnitude, location (latitude and longitude), depth, and type of earthquake.
- 2. Data Preparation : Clean the dataset to remove any duplicates or erroneous entries. Format the date field to enable time-based analysis. Create calculated fields if necessary, such as categorizing magnitudes into different ranges (e.g., minor, moderate, major).
- 3. Data Import : Open Tableau Desktop and connect to the prepared dataset. Load the data and verify that all fields are correctly recognized (e.g., date as a date type, numeric fields as measures).
- 4. Creating Visualizations
	  Map Visualization: Plotted earthquake locations on a geographical map, using size and color to represent magnitude.
	  Time Series Chart: Created a line chart to show the frequency of earthquakes over time.
	  Magnitude Distribution: Developed histograms or bar charts to display the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.
- 5. Dashboard Assembly : Dragged and dropped individual visualizations onto the dashboard workspace. Arranged components for clarity and flow, ensuring an intuitive layout.
- 6. Interactivity Implementation : Added filters to allow users to customize views by date, magnitude, and region. Enabled tooltips for detailed information on hover over data points.
- 7. Design and Formatting : Adjusted colors, fonts, and styles for visual appeal and readability. Ensured consistent design elements across the dashboard.
